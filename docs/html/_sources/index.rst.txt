GarNet is an epigenomics data exploration tool. For more information about the scientific uses of GarNet,
please see the Readme_. To report an error, please refer to the Issues_.

Some important notes:

- GarNet mostly uses tab-delimited files, otherwise known as tsv's. BED files are already tsv, so no worries there.

- In order to map peaks, a genome annotation file is required, processed into a "GarNet File". There is such a file for hg19, mm9, and mm10.
